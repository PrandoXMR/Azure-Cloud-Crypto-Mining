subtitle: How to spend your Azure Free Credits

This guide will show you how to:
- Create an Azure account
- Create a Monero-Wallet
- Start mining
- What to expect

### Create an Azure Account

There are different options for getting an Azure account with free credits:

- If you don't already have one, you can sign up at [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/] to get 150$ of free credits.
You WILL need to provide credit card information, which is used to verify your identity (see [Azure FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/free-account-faq/)).

- If you are a **student**, you can register for free at [https://azure.microsoft.com/nl-nl/free/students/] and receive $100 to spend on Azure. You will **NOT** need a credit card to create your account.

- If you have an MSDN subscription (probably from work), you will be provided with 50$-150$ credits every month. This is a private subscription, and can not be monitored by others. So why not use it to mine some crypto?

### Create a Monero Wallet (XRM)

You need to create a wallet to store your hard-earned crypto in. I personally use Mymonero: [https://mymonero.com/], but you can use any XRM address for mining.

### Set-up 

Create a resource group
